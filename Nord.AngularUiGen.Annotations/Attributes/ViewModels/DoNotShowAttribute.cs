  /// While there is already a <see cref="System.Web.Mvc.HiddenInputAttribute"/> which serves much the same purpose, it's MVC-specific and requires a reference to MVC.  Furthermore, I ran into issues with MVC versions being out-of-sync, causing it not to be detected.  Using this custom attribute instead is my fix.
